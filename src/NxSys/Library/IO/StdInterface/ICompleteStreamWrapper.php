/**
 * Interface for use with a *complete* streamWrapper
 *
 * Usage: Use like any other interface except now you can 1) rely on this 
 * class outside of StreamsExt and not have to use refelection 2) use the
 * ICompleteStreamWrapper type hint to help with that. E.g. you could now 
 * handle, manage, and register streamwrappers more easily.
 *
 * Note: StreamsExt will behave differently depending on what method from a
 * wrapper is defined. As such, do not use unless you intend to configure each
 * method listed below (ie don't cheat and "stub" some out). It has warnings
 * that it wil raise in the in the course of operation that would reflect if a
 * method (and thus a feature) are implemented.
 *
 * Note2: The $context property is not enforced by the interface (it can't be)
 * but it *must* be defined, and be made public. StreamsExt will manipulate this
 * (see link)
